### Dependencies

* Docker
* [Ahoy] (https://github.com/ahoy-cli/ahoy/releases)

### Getting Started

#### Prepare for local development:

```bash
ahoy up
```

When you want to stop containers, you can run:

```bash
ahoy stop
```

Once created your containers; you should prepare your local site.

Generate local settings file:

```bash
ahoy site local-settings
```

Prepare the local site:

```bash
composer install
npm install
```

Install the local site

```bash
ahoy site install
```

### Site UUID.
Site uuid can be found in the installation script. You should create a variable named `SITE_UUID` in CircleCI and set it to that value so that CircleCI builds work as expected.


In order to run behat tests; you should execute:

```bash
ahoy site behat
```

### Build Environment

To build this environment you need recent docker compose and docker versions.
After placing Drupal in the right folder, you should run `docker-compose up -d` or `ahoy up` and voil√°! You can access your Drupal installation at the url provided by `ahoy docker url`

## Installed Stuff

### Nginx

Nginx is running in port 80. Use `ahoy docker url` to get the url.

### PHP-FPM

PHP is running in a separate container using fpm in port 9000 (not accessible from host).

### Mariadb

Credentials are in environment variables in docker-compose.yml.

### Solr

Please be patient because it takes around 3-5 minutes to start when you create the containers.

Core is created as "collection1". Solr address is "solr". Path is "/solr".

### Cli
